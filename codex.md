# Codex Vitae

## Instructions

**If you are Debra:**

1. As often as you can: re-read your [Type 3 beliefs](#type-3-opinions) (opinions).
2. At the beginning of every month, read the whole thing and make any necessary edits.
3. At the beginning of every year, archive the document.
4. Around your birthday every year, write a new yearly report.

**If you aren't Debra:**

1. Read this with the understanding that you are different than me — the way I live my life is not the way you should live yours.
2. Read the [Glossary](#glossary) for a general intro to my favorite ideas, starting with [What is this?](#what-is-this), then come back and read through the [Beliefs](#beliefs) that seem interesting to you. 
3. Check the [Changelog](https://github.com/debrakao/codex/commits/master/Codex.md) for updates since you last visited.
4. Consider creating your own Codex ([here's a template](https://www.penflip.com/terrie/codex-vitae-template))

## Beliefs

### Type 1: Metabeliefs
Beliefs about beliefs.

- This document's purpose is to capture my beliefs about the universe. 
- This document's benefits grow in a compound interest kind of way, over time, as beliefs course correct over time, and build on one another.
- It's always incomplete and out of date. 
- Some of these beliefs will be proven wrong. Some won't be proven wrong but will be wrong anyway.
- I’m open to changing my mind at any time about any belief by evidence, persuasion, whimsy, or chance. 
- I believe beliefs are best categorized into four types: beliefs about beliefs (metabeliefs, i.e. this one), beliefs about perceptions (how reality seems to be), beliefs about the meaning of reality (opinions about how myself and others should approach life), and beliefs about the future (predictions about how things will be in the future).
- Making and maintaining this document is useful and fun. And increasingly rewarding over time. 

### Type 2: Perceptions
How reality seems to be. 2A is about how my mind and senses seem to work, 2B is about my take on spirituality, and 2C is about how I think the external world can be best explained based on the information I have.

#### 2A Perceptions: Senses
Personal mental and physical abilities, constraints, and biases.

- Perception/sensation is the awareness of things changing. We can't perceive or sense things that aren't changing. 
- Free will is mostly an illusion, but a nice one to keep because it is highly practical.
- We are all building an incomplete model of the universe in our heads and usually operate under the assumption that this model is the real universe (again, it's practical).
- Our mental model of the universe evolved so we could better predict and act on long-term threats and opportunities. 
- The best way for our brains to model predictions is to create stories.
- Consciousness receives a stream of observer moments and turns them into stories. 
- Each observer moment is a static model of the universe captured in freeze frame, with a frozen model of the past, present, future, and every concept. It gets updated anew each moment, along with a fading memory of past moments.
- Consciousness is the sensation of our mental model of the universe constantly changing itself to integrate new information.
- Consciousness evolved to allow our mental model of the universe to examine, repair, and improve itself.
- Playing lots of games (of any kind: video, board, card, other) will make us build more accurate models of the universe than people who don’t.
- We can change our behavior and habits but it requires a ridiculous amount of energy.
- Most of the time (if not all of the time) we don’t change ourselves, but are rather changed by other things. That doesn’t mean we can’t tell a story about how we changed ourselves, and believe it.
- We create mental heuristics to reduce the amount of energy to retrieve, sort, and select from lists of likely possibilities. 
- The biproduct of mental heuristics is that we are biased at all times in proportion to the number of heuristics we use.
- We are the sum of our biases. 
- To name a few: We tend to favor the beautiful, the reaffirming, and the expected. We tend to attribute too much credit to success (and under-credit luck).
- We will die.
- Biases are inevitable. It is our applications of these biases that determine whether we are racist, bigoted, or 
- Empathy...

#### 2B Perceptions: Supersenses
My take on the spiritual and supernatural.

- We don't have a purpose given to us, but it's okay if we make one up.
- My self-declared purpose is to enjoy quality time (with myself, with others, and with my interests) by discovering and removing obstacles that hinder quality time.
- Frequently remembering we will die increases the quality of our life.
- Life is already lost. The only honest way to approach it is from a perspective of gratitude.
- Souls don't exist as separate from the physical body.
- The gods of organized religion don't exist.
- Intention can't create reality (it just primes our perception of it, and makes us more likely to notice opportunities).
- Astrology is (fun) entertainment, like the Myers Briggs test.
- Science can't explain everything. Most in the "not yet" bucket, but some in the "never" bucket.
- There is no heaven or hell.
- We have no cosmic significance. Other than that the cosmos is significant and we are part of it.

#### 2C Perceptions: Explanatory
Science, politics, and the universe.

- The human brain (in its current state of evolution) can't comprehend the universe.
- Non-carbon-based life forms exist.
- Aliens exist. 
- Global warming is real.
- Technology will eventually disrupt all other human-created institutions (politics, religion, identity, economics, energy).
- As history progresses, power will tend to be more quickly redistributed when it gets too heavy at the top.
- Privacy is just a side effect of people not being truly connected.
- Being good/moral increasingly becomes our default state as we learn more about the world and are more connected with others.
- Vaccinations are good for babies and society.

### Type 3: Opinions
Beliefs about how I interpret my perceptions and synthesize the meaning of reality. 3A is about what this means for my own approach to life, and 3B is about how I believe society should be structured.

#### 3A: Opinions: Shoulds
How I believe I should approach life. These are all opt-in and apply only to myself.

- I should regularly verify that I want to continue opting-in to everything in this document on the first of every month. 
- I should create a new monthly report on the first of every month.
- I should create a new yearly report every year on my birthday.
- I should strive to know what I really believe, and to make sure my beliefs work well together.
- I should not dilly-dally.
- I should be my word.
- I should have good intentions.
- I should admit to being the maker of my own meaning.
- I should not feel sorry for myself and avoid competitive suffering.
- I should have a vision that I'm striving for.
- I should rally others with my vision.
- I should be the change I want to see.
- I should stake my reputation on my better self.
- I should be comfortable with the consequences of being who I am.
- I should make my own advice and take it.
- I should manage my stress, health, and clarity by consistently eating well, exercising, and getting enough sleep.
- I should study my mistakes.
- I should retry things I don’t like every once in a while.
- I should go slow, work hard, and avoid shortcuts.
- I should cultivate quality time with myself, with others, and with my interests.
- I should face things that make me uncomfortable.
- I should take responsibility for things I find important, even if I can’t fully control them.

## Glossary
 
### What is this?
This document was started in November 2016 in response to the outcome of the US presidential election. It’s a way for me to remember who I am, catch inconsistencies in how I respond to different events in the world, react to current events from a position of how I believe the world is, should be, and will become. 

### Codex vitae
This is an idea coined by Robin Sloan in his book [Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-Novel/dp/1250037751). The idea is to write a book, the Codex Vitae or Book of Life, that represents everything I have learned in my life. If I lost all of my memories somehow, this could be something that helped me remember who I am.
